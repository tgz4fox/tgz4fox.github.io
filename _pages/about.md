I'm in the third year of my Ph.D. in Systems Science at Qingdao University. My research interest includes distributed optimization, non-cooperative games, nonlinear systems, and control systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuan-Xin Li](https://lxy.lnut.edu.cn/info/14155/184414.htm), Liaoning University of Technology. I was advised by Prof. Xiaoping Liu from Lakehead University.
